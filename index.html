        <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            This dataset comes from NYC Open Data and contains information 
            about leading causes of death in New York City from 2007–2021.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data includes number of deaths, death rates, age-adjusted death rates,
            sex, race/ethnicity, and cause of death.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Potential Biases:</strong>
            Data may reflect disparities in healthcare access, reporting inconsistencies,
            racial classification inconsistencies (e.g., "Black Non-Hispanic" vs 
            "Non-Hispanic Black"), and underreporting in certain populations.
        </p>

    <h2>Summary Statistics</h2>

    <h3>Quantitative Variables</h3>

    <div class="stat-box">
        <h4>Deaths</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> 602.96</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> 220</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 937.48</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> 5</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> 7050</li>
            <li><strong>IQR:</strong> 419</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The mean number of deaths per record (602.96) is much higher than the median (220), 
            indicating a strong right-skewed distribution. This suggests that a small number of 
            causes account for very high death totals, while most causes have relatively fewer 
            deaths. The large standard deviation and wide range further confirm substantial 
            variability across causes and demographic groups.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="stat-box">
        <h4>Death Rate</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> 56.26</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> 20.1</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 75.60</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> 2.4</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> 491.4</li>
            <li><strong>IQR:</strong> 66.06</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The mean death rate (56.26) is substantially higher than the median (20.1), 
            again indicating right skew. Most causes have relatively low death rates, 
            but a few exhibit extremely high rates. The large spread in values reflects 
            major differences in mortality across diseases and demographic groups.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Ordinal Variables</h3>

    <div class="stat-box">
        <h4>Year</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> 2014.14</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> 2014</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 4.33</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> 2007</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> 2021</li>
            <li><strong>IQR:</strong> 8</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The dataset spans from 2007 to 2021, with a median year of 2014. 
            The relatively small standard deviation suggests the data is fairly 
            evenly distributed across years. This variable allows for analysis 
            of mortality trends over time and helps identify unusual spikes 
            or changes in later years.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="stat-box">
        <h4>Age-Adjusted Death Rate</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> 53.61</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> 19.8</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 68.11</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> 2.5</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> 414.59</li>
            <li><strong>IQR:</strong> 69.16</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The age-adjusted death rate also shows strong right skew, as the mean 
            (53.61) is much higher than the median (19.8). Some causes have 
            disproportionately high mortality when adjusting for age. Age-adjusted 
            rates allow fairer comparisons across populations with different 
            age distributions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Categorical Variables</h3>

    <div class="stat-box">
        <h4>Sex</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Female:</strong> 685 records</li>
            <li><strong>Male:</strong> 688 records</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The dataset contains nearly equal numbers of male and female records, 
            allowing meaningful comparison between sexes. Because the counts are 
            balanced, observed differences in mortality are less likely to be 
            caused by data imbalance.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="stat-box">
        <h4>Race / Ethnicity</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Asian and Pacific Islander: 333</li>
            <li>Hispanic: 331</li>
            <li>White Non-Hispanic: 176</li>
            <li>Black Non-Hispanic: 178</li>
            <li>Non-Hispanic Black: 154</li>
            <li>Non-Hispanic White: 155</li>
            <li>Not Stated/Unknown: 46</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are inconsistencies in racial labeling (for example, 
            "Black Non-Hispanic" vs. "Non-Hispanic Black"), which may introduce 
            classification bias. Some groups appear split across multiple labels, 
            which could distort comparisons if not cleaned properly. The unequal 
            distribution across categories suggests careful interpretation is necessary 
            when comparing mortality across racial and ethnic groups.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="stat-box">
        <h4>Leading Causes of Death</h4>
        <p>
            The dataset contains 24 distinct leading causes of death. 
            Some categories such as Diseases of Heart and Malignant Neoplasms 
            appear frequently and account for large death totals, while 
            others appear only rarely. This uneven distribution contributes 
            to the strong right-skew observed in the quantitative variables.
        </p>
    </div>

<section>
    <h2>Data Distributions</h2>
    <h3>Distribution of Deaths</h3>
    <img src = "deaths_hist.png" alt = "Deaths Histogram" width="500">
    <p>
        The histogram of total deaths shows a strong right-skewed distribution. 
        Most causes of death have relatively low death counts, while a small 
        number of causes have extremely high totals. This pattern explains why 
        the mean (602.96) is much higher than the median (220). 
        The skew suggests that mortality in NYC is concentrated among a few 
        dominant causes.
    </p>
    <h3>Death Rate Distribution</h3>
    <img src = "death_rate.png" alt = "Death Rate Distribution" width="500">
    <p>
        The distribution of death rates mirrors the pattern seen in total deaths. 
        Most causes have relatively low rates, but several causes show very high 
        mortality rates. The long right tail supports the large standard deviation 
        and wide range observed in the summary statistics.
    </p>
    <h3>Records by Year</h3>
    <img src="year_bar.png" alt="Bar Chart of Records by Year" width="500">
    <p>
        The number of records appears relatively consistent across years from 
        2007 to 2021. This suggests that the dataset provides stable annual 
        coverage, allowing reliable trend analysis over time.
    </p>
    <h3>Age-Adjusted Death Rate (Boxplot)</h3>
    <img src="age_adjusted_boxplot.png" alt="Boxplot of Age-Adjusted Death Rate" width="500">
    <p>
        The boxplot shows substantial variability in age-adjusted death rates, 
        with several high outliers. This confirms that certain causes are 
        disproportionately deadly even after adjusting for age differences 
        across populations.
    </p>

    <h3>Counts by Sex</h3>
    <img src="sex_bar.png" alt="Bar Chart by Sex" width="500">
    <p>
        The dataset includes nearly equal representation of male and female 
        records, enabling meaningful comparison between sexes in later analyses.
    </p>

    <h3>Counts by Race/Ethnicity</h3>
    <img src="race_bar.png" alt="Bar Chart by Race/Ethnicity" width="500">
    <p>
        The racial and ethnic distribution shows uneven representation across 
        categories. Additionally, inconsistencies in labeling (e.g., similar 
        groups listed separately) highlight potential classification bias 
        within the dataset.
    </p>

    <h2>Relationships in the Data</h2>

    <h3>Top 10 Leading Causes of Death</h3>
    <img src="top10_causes.png" alt="Top 10 Leading Causes of Death" width="500">
    <p>
        The bar chart of the top 10 leading causes shows that Diseases of the Heart 
        and Malignant Neoplasms (Cancer) account for significantly more deaths 
        than other causes. The large gap between these and the remaining categories 
        supports the hypothesis that heart disease is the dominant cause of mortality 
        in NYC.
    </p>

    <h3>Average Death Rate Over Time</h3>
    <img src="death_rate_trend.png" alt="Average Death Rate Over Time" width="500">
    <p>
        The line chart shows a noticeable spike in average death rate around 
        2020–2021. This increase suggests a significant shift in mortality during 
        this period, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. This pattern 
        directly informed the hypothesis predicting increased mortality during 
        these years.
    </p>

    <h3>Top 10 Causes by Sex</h3>
    <img src="top10_by_sex.png" alt="Top 10 Causes by Sex" width="500">
    <p>
        Comparing the top 10 causes by sex reveals differences in mortality patterns 
        between males and females. In several major categories, male death totals 
        appear higher, suggesting potential sex-based disparities in mortality. 
        This visualization supports the hypothesis that mortality differs by sex 
        across major diseases.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Testable Hypotheses</h2>

    <div class="hypothesis">
        <h3>Hypothesis 1</h3>
        <p><strong>Diseases of the Heart account for significantly more deaths than other leading causes in New York City.</strong></p>
        <p>
            This hypothesis was informed by the visualization of the top 10 leading causes 
            of death. The bar chart shows a clear gap between Diseases of the Heart and 
            most other causes, indicating that heart disease consistently ranks as one 
            of the dominant contributors to mortality. Because the difference in total 
            deaths appears substantial, this hypothesis can be tested statistically 
            by comparing mean death counts across causes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="hypothesis">
        <h3>Hypothesis 2</h3>
        <p><strong>Death rates increased significantly during 2020–2021 compared to previous years.</strong></p>
        <p>
            The line chart of average death rate over time shows a noticeable spike 
            around 2020–2021. This visual trend suggests a significant shift in mortality 
            during those years. Given the historical context of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
            this increase appears meaningful and testable by comparing average death 
            rates before and during this period.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="hypothesis">
    <h3>Hypothesis 3</h3>
    <p><strong>In the majority of leading causes of death, females experience higher total deaths than males.</strong></p>
    <p>
        This hypothesis is based on the grouped bar chart comparing the top 10 leading 
        causes of death by sex. In several categories, female death totals appear higher 
        than male totals. This pattern suggests a possible overall trend in which females 
        experience greater mortality counts across diseases. This hypothesis can be 
        tested by comparing total deaths by sex across all leading causes.
