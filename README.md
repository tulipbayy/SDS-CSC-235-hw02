# SDS-CSC-235-hw02: Communicating Data

# Authors: Eva Soboleva, Bayansulu Tulepbayeva

## Outline

This repository contains the starter code and instructions you will need for this assignment; fork and then clone it to your machine.  

In this assignment you will create a simple, interactive webpage that showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) you performed on a dataset of your choosing. You will need to modify index.html, style.css, and index.js from this repository to make your webpage. 

## Phase 1: EDA

Choose a dataset related to a topic of interest to you. It is strongly recommended that you use data from a source other than Kaggle. Here are some suggestions:

- [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
- [Massachusetts Data Hub](https://data.mass.gov/)
- [Analyze Boston](https://data.boston.gov/)
- [Census Datasets](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets.html)
- [Data.gov](https://data.gov/)


Using whatever tool(s) you are most comfortable with, perform an exploratory data analysis of your data. Your analysis should result in:

1. Summary statistics for at least 2 quantitative variables, 2 ordinal variables, and 2 categorical variables. 
2. Distribution / Frequency visualizations for each variable included #1. 
3. Three visualizations investigating potential relationships between two (or more) variables in the data. 
4. Three testable hypotheses about the subject matter, informed by your EDA. 

## Phase 2: Website 

Using the starter code in this repository, create a website that walks a reader through your EDA, and explains how you got to your testable hypotheses. 

You website must:

1. Be well formatted with appropriate titles, headings, page divisions, etc.. 
2. Provide a synopsis of the raw data with a link to the source, brief overview of what the data captures, and brief discussion of biases present in the data.
3. Display and contextualize each summary statistic and visualization generated in phase 1. 
4. List each testable hypothesis from phase 1, and communicate how EDA led to that hypothesis. 
5. Highlight at least one HTML element in response to hovering over it.
6. Modidy at least one HTML element repeatedly in response to a button click.
